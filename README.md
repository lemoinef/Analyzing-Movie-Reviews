# Project: Analyzing Movie Reviews

In this project, we'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on movie review scores. The team at FiveThirtyEight was intrigued by the discrepancy between different movie review platforms. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `analyzing_movie_reviews.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Analyzing Movie Reviews/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook analyzing_movie_reviews.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook analyzing_movie_reviews.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included as `fandango_score_comparison.csv`. This dataset is provided by FiveThirtyEight.
